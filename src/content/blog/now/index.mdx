Currently working with select partners on boutique educational products for developers. Some of that work is documented on [badass.dev](https://badass.dev/)

In 2022 I released a podcast series focused on [Badass Course Builders](https://badass.dev/podcast/course-builders/). It is focused on the business of building educational products for web developers as independant creators.

Total TypeScript is a learning site that we are working on with Matt Pocock that focuses on teaching intermediate to advanced TypeScript for working web developers. In December of 2022 we [did a pre-release launch](https://badass.dev/launch-of-a-developer-education-product) and then did the full release of the Core Volume in April of 2023. We are working on additional modules for the product and will be releasing them in the future.

## Learning

* [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) by Andrej Karpathy is a deep dive, diy, from scratch introduction to neural networks. It is a great way to learn the fundamentals of neural networks and how they work. It's got a decent handful of calculus, linear algebra, and python which can all be challenging, but in the best sort of way. I highly recommend it.
* Building a small in-house data center for machine learning and personal education. Taking lots of notes and learning a ton about networking, system administration, gpu-accelerated workflows, linux, and more. Kuberbnetes gets a bad rap in many circles, and I'm curious why. Digging in to KubeFlow in particular. For the process I converted my gaming Windows PC to a Linux workstation running Xubuntu and swapped out the 3090 for 2x a4500s. Also including a 60TB NAS and upgraded the network to 10gbe. 

## Health and Fitness

In December of 2022 I committed to a year of working with a [My Body Tutor](https://www.mybodytutor.com/) coach. Working with [Walter](https://www.mybodytutor.com/tutors/walter) has been great and not what I expected at all. As I progress towards my initial weight loss goals, I'm considering how to transition those goals over to being fitness oriented. Thinking about the activities that have for the most part been physically impossible for me, or at least very difficult, and how to make them possible. I'm also thinking about how to make fitness a part of my life in a way that is sustainable and enjoyable. 

I'm not sure what that looks like yet, but I'm excited to find out.

One big change for me was adding daily [yoga stretching focused on hip mobility using this program from Yoga Body](https://www.yogabody.com/21-day-hips/). It's been **life changing** and I can't overstate how much better my body feels. In the past I've got straight for the heavy weight lifting, but would eventually get derailed by injury and pain. This time I'm taking a different approach and focusing on mobility and flexibility first. I'm also doing a lot of walking, and I'm looking forward to getting back into hiking and maybe a little cycling.

Also got a standup paddle board to enjoy on the water here in the Pacific Northwest.

As my fitness level increases for the first time I'm considering crossfit as an efficient way to get a full body workout in a short amount of time. It's not really my "cup o' tea", but there's an excellent gym 5 minutes from my house and it is holistic and effective.

## Modular Synthesis

For the past several years I've been exploring sound design and music adjacent noise with an ever evolving, complex, gnarly, beast of a eurorack system that I love like a 6th child.

I release [on tik tok as __noise_complaint](https://www.tiktok.com/@_noise_complaint) if you're into that sort of thing.
